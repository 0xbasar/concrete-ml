# Resources

The interested reader has some more resources to look at, in addition to this documentation:

1. our [community page](https://community.zama.ai/c/concrete-ml/8), whose link is at the top right of doc pages
1. the different blogs we publish, currently located on [Medium](https://medium.com/zama-ai). We can notably mention [this blog post](https://medium.com/zama-ai/privacy-preserving-insurance-quotes-356b9719b760) where we described the use of a Poisson regressor to tackle a real-life use case in a privacy preserving setting

Also, we expect to publish some academical and white papers, explaining some interesting parts of our package, would it be on the engineering or on the scientific sides.
