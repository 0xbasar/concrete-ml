# Resources

The interested reader has even more resources to review, in addition to this documentation:

1. Our [community page](https://community.zama.ai/c/concrete-ml/8), the link for which can be found at the top right of doc pages.
1. The varied blogs we publish, currently located on [Medium](https://medium.com/zama-ai). Notably, [this blog post](https://medium.com/zama-ai/privacy-preserving-insurance-quotes-356b9719b760) describes the use of a Poisson regressor to tackle a real-life use case in a privacy-preserving setting.

Additionally, we plan to publish academic and white papers explaining interesting aspects of our work, covering both the engineering and scientific sides of our offering.
