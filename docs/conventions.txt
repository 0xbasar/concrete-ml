Let's use following conventions for the docs. If a new convention needs to be decided, let's agree and then add it here.

- numpy (ie, not Numpy or NumPy)
- **Concrete ML** (with space and bold)
- Main titles (with a single #) are `Capitalized at Each Letter`
- Sub titles (with two or more #s) are `Capitalized only for first letter`
- Use links from doc root (ie, ../../user/explanation/quantization.md) instead of using the smallest number of ../ that works; it makes files easier to move
- torch (and not Torch or PyTorch)
