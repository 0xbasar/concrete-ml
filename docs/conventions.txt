The only place we can say we/our is in a blog post written by a named author. Anything signed Zama should not use we/our. So, no "We" or "Our" in our documentation.

Let's use following conventions for the docs. If a new convention needs to be decided, let's agree and then add it here.

style:
    1. The documentation can address the user directly e.g. "you can find out more at ..", but this
        style should not be abused, do not be too colloquial !
    2. The documentation should not refer to its writers or to Concrete-ML developers/Zama as "we",
        and thus it should not use "our" either.
        
terms:

    1. Use hyphenated versions for portmanteaus, unless the term is in the dictionary e.g.
        - bit-width [not: bitwidth, bit width]
        - input-set, data-set
        - database, codebase is fine (not data-base, code-base)
        - de-quantize/re-quantize
    
    2. "a FHE program" not "an FHE program"
    
    - Machine Learning or machine learning, depends on the context
    - google is a verb ("you can google" but not "you can Google") : but try to avoid this

Programs:

    Jupyter
    NumPy but "Concrete Numpy"
    Concrete-ML in text but Concrete ML in titles, same Concrete-anything; concrete-ml when in command line
    Concrete[- ]Something without **
    pytest except when title where it is capitalized
    Python
    torch (for the code) and PyTorch (for the product)
    scikit, sklearn and scikit-learn are acceptable
    Hummingbird
    Docker (for the product) or docker (for the binary)
    Poetry (for the product) or poetry (for the binary)
    Make (for the product) or make (for the command line)
    PoissonRegression or Poisson Regression (depends on the context, we'll fix it in Zama)
    macOS
    bare OS

Titles:

    - Main titles (with a single #) are `Capitalized at Each Letter`
    - Sub titles (with two or more #s) are `Capitalized only for first letter`
    - ### titles: must have a . at the end

Links:

    - Use links from doc root (ie, ../../user/explanation/quantization.md) instead of using the smallest number of ../ that works; it makes files easier to move
